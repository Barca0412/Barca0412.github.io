excerpt: 'This paper Employed the PLS method to analyze the volatility of the Chinese stock market, using 120 macroeconomic variables from the FRED-MD database in the United States. The results indicate a significant relationship with factors such as the global economic system, supply chain dynamics, and the China-US trade war. This paper also calculated the systemic risk posed by Chinese companies to the US macroeconomy, using macroeconomic indicators and individual stock returns, and applied PCA and Sparse-PCA for dimensionality reduction. Found that Sparse-PCA improves the economic interpretability of the 10 principal components more effectively than traditional PCA methods'

This paper Employed the PLS method to analyze the volatility of the Chinese stock market, using 120 macroeconomic variables from the FRED-MD database in the United States. The results indicate a significant relationship with factors such as the global economic system, supply chain dynamics, and the China-US trade war.
