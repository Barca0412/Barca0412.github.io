I'm Guohao Qi(齐国皓), an undergraduate majoring in Economic Statistics at College of Finance and Statistics, Hunan University (graduating in 2025, 25fall-US). 

I'm interested in both **Fintech**(including Cryptocurrency market) and **Empirical Asset Pricing** in academia📋, including stock anomalies and cross-sectional returns, Behavioral Finance, and the application of machine learning in financial analysis. My interests also extend to **Quantitative Investment**📈 in industry.

🔭I’m currently working on Daily-frequency strategy Research, Stock Factor Mining, Portfolio Optimization. 💬 You can ask me about Fund Analysis, FoF Research, Risk Management(Barra, etc.), Algorithmic Factor Mining and other related things. Additionally, 🤔 I’m currently learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, High-Frequency trading.

By the way, I enjoy photography, playing soccer and hiking. 

It is noteworthy to mention that I am currently taking a **Gap Year**. Specifically, during my senior year (the 2023-2024 academic year, during which I am now on a sabbatical), I have opted to take a break from my studies. In pursuit of a deeper exploration of my interests, I have ventured to Beijing to work as a quantitative researcher at a private equity fund for six months (thus far).
